Pentester in training. Try not to mind my potentially half broken scripts and tools. 
All public repos are probably a work-in-progress.

- Iâ€™m currently working on: studying for the PNPT Certification by TCM Security.
- Iâ€™m currently learning: bash and python.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: my ping-sweep script! Public repo: https://github.com/bishDOTexe/ping-sweep
- Iâ€™m looking for help with: ideas on preferred open-source monitoring tools!
